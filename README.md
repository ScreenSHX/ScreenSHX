### Todo
``webrtc,native-screensharing,windows-screenrecording`` - This will be added some time soon. A test environment will need to go into place to test webrtc, and native recording tools.

``linux`` - A proper linux look-at will be needed.<br>
``node-mac-permissions`` - Adding permissions for the ability to Screenrecord, Full Disk Access, and bluetooth wil be needed to operate on macOS. Current state does not require this.
